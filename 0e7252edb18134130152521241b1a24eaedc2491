Implementation Plan: Remove #retract command

Files deleted:
1. src/modules/retract-release.js - Core retract logic (posts comment, closes issue)
2. src/publish/retract.js - GitHub Actions entry point for retract
3. src/modules/__tests__/retract-release.js - Tests for retract-release module
4. .github/workflows/retract.yml - Workflow triggered by #retract comments on issues

Files edited:
5. README.md - Removed #retract branch from the Mermaid flowchart and the
   entire "Retracting Release Request" documentation section (lines 60-63)
6. src/modules/__tests__/update-issue.js - Removed the #retract instruction
   line from two test fixture strings that included issue body templates

Verification:
- All 16 tests pass (yarn test)
- Lint clean (yarn lint)
- Prettier clean (yarn prettier)
