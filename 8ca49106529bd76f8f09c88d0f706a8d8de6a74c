Implementation Plan
===================

All 3 open CodeQL code-scanning alerts share the same rule:
actions/missing-workflow-permissions (medium severity, CWE-275).

Without explicit permissions, workflows inherit the repository/org default
GITHUB_TOKEN scopes which may be overly broad (read-write prior to Feb 2023).

Fixes:

1. .github/workflows/test.yml (Alert #6)
   - Only checks out code, caches deps, and runs tests.
   - Permissions needed: contents: read

2. .github/workflows/publish.yml (Alert #5)
   - Checks out this repo, writes issue comments, adds/removes labels,
     and closes issues via GITHUB_TOKEN. Cross-repo operations use the
     Release Bot app token so they do not require additional scopes.
   - Permissions needed: contents: read, issues: write

3. .github/workflows/auto-approve.yml (Alert #2)
   - Currently uses only the Release Bot app token (not GITHUB_TOKEN),
     but PR #7119 adds an actions/checkout step (sparse checkout) which
     requires contents: read.
   - Permissions needed: contents: read
