## Implementation Plan

### Problem
The auto-approve workflow had a 40+ line if-condition with one
startsWith() check per repo. Adding a repo meant editing workflow YAML.

### Approach Considered
1. Plain text file + checkout (chosen)
2. YAML/JSON config file (overkill — no metadata needed)
3. JS module in src/ (adds complexity for a simple list match)
4. GitHub repo variable (loses version control / PR review)
5. Inline YAML env var (still a long list in the workflow)

### Design Decisions
- Plain text file: simplest format, easiest to review in PRs, one-line
  diffs when adding repos.
- Sparse checkout: only fetches auto-approve-repos.txt, near-instant.
- Job-level gate: actor check + startsWith('publish: ') skips the job
  entirely for unrelated issues — no checkout or token wasted.
- sed + grep -qxF: extracts repo from title, exact full-line match
  with fixed strings prevents substring false positives.
- Env var for title: prevents shell injection from crafted titles
  (security improvement over inline ${{ }} interpolation).
- Removed getsentry-release actor: only the GitHub App bot opens
  these issues now.

### Maintenance
To add a new repo: append a line to auto-approve-repos.txt. No
workflow YAML editing needed.
